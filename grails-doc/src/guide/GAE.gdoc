GPars can be run on the "Google App Engine (GAE)":https://developers.google.com/appengine/ .
It can be made part of Groovy and Java GAE applications as well as a plugged into Gaelyk.
The small "GPars App Engine integration library":https://github.com/musketyr/gpars-appengine
provides all the necessary infrastructure to hook GAE services into GPars.
Although you'll be running on GAE threads and leveraging GAE timer services, the high-level abstractions remain the same.
With a few restrictions you can still use GPars actors, dataflow, agents, parallel collections and other handy concepts.

Please refer to the "GPars App Engine library":https://github.com/musketyr/gpars-appengine documentation for details
on how to proceed with GPars on GAE.
